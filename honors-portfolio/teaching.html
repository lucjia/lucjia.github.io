              <div class="pad-top-10">
                <p>In 2012, after more than six years of taking inline skating lessons, I became one of the youngest skaters to pass the Level 1 Certification
                  and began teaching inline skating at <a href="https://skatejourneys.org/">Skate Journeys Skate School</a> in Bellevue, Washington.
                  Every weekend, I would lace up my skates to teach both kids and adults how to find balance, perseverance, and excitement on wheels.
                  Though I spent more than six summers as a camp counselor, I could still see myself in my students' shoes (skates?) and loved being able to
                  work with students to develop individual plans for perfecting their technique.</p>
                <p>Throughout my time at UW, I’ve developed a passion for creating community, advocating for equity, and expanding access to CS education.
                  My journey in teaching CS began in 2019, when I was accepted to TA for the
                  <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190e/19au/">Early Fall Start (EFS) course</a> I had taken the year prior.
                  Having been in the students' shoes, I spent months developing course and extracurricular materials to support incoming students
                  from underrepresented backgrounds (from low-resource schools, first-generation students, students with disabilities, etc.)
                  so they would have the tools to combat these same feelings of impostor syndrome I felt before. Through teaching EFS,
                  I felt my joy for teaching return – it was this same sense of purpose I'd felt when teaching inline skating back in high school.</p>
                <p>Since 2019, I’ve been a TA for a variety of courses in the Allen School. As a TA for HCI, I consistently remind students that
                  technology is not built independently of its users – it must be built intentionally, with, by, and for those who will ultimately benefit from it.
                  I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to guest lecture about visual design and communication this quarter in HCI. My love for
                  empowering students and helping them navigate the complexities of both life and education will continue to drive me in the future,
                  and I aim to build on these teaching experiences even further in graduate school by designing and teaching a new course focused on accessible technology.</p>
