      <p id="publishdate">Published May 21, 2019 at 10:30 AM - Written by Lucy Jiang</p>
      <p>Hey everybody! After a busy quarter of fulfilling cupcake orders and baking
        creative custom cakes, I decided to tie my passion for baking to my schoolwork
        and baked a cake to represent an important, unforgettable part of history.</p>
      <p>Jamie Ford’s novel, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/54454/hotel-on-the-corner-of-bitter-and-sweet-by-jamie-ford/9780345505347/" id="hcbslinks">
        <i>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</i></a>, deeply analyzes the conflict and clash
        between American, Chinese, and Japanese cultures during World War II. As a young
        Chinese-American boy, protagonist Henry Lee faces the realities of discrimination
        and erasure of identity during World War II – throughout his youth, he wears a button
        that states his ethnicity in an attempt to avoid prejudice for being Japanese. While
        Henry finds a friend in Keiko Okabe, a Japanese-American girl at his school who faces
        similar struggles, his father’s traditional cultural prejudices against the Japanese
        keeps them apart. Furthermore, Keiko’s entire family experiences brutal and unjust
        internment and other hardships brought upon the entire Japanese-American community
        as a result of Executive Order 9066. These cultural tensions drive large groups of
        individuals apart, preventing the formation of a cohesive, multi-ethnic community in
        Seattle.</p>
      <p>The title of the novel, <i>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</i>, focuses on
        a dichotomy that seems to exist throughout all of history – the unavoidable bitterness
        of loss, defeat, and prejudice that so starkly contrasts the sweetness of reunion,
        victory, and justice. Throughout the book, Henry and Keiko experience discrimination as
        the two Asian-American students at their school, who “taunted… sneered and glared
        suspiciously” (21) at them in the cafeteria. As Keiko and her family are sent away to
        Camp Minidoka, the bitterness of Japanese internment and Henry’s growing conflict with
        his traditional father are interspersed with the sweetness of Henry and Keiko’s love
        and his genuine promises to “‘[wait for her] when this is all over’” (232). Despite
        his promises and best intentions, Henry and Keiko fall out of contact for many, many years.</p>
      <p>Henry soon finds companionship with Ethel Chen, the “young [Chinese] woman from the
        post office” who watched Henry send Keiko letter after letter with no reply. Henry’s
        bitterness – for him, “not knowing [why she didn’t reply] hurt almost as much as losing
        her” (257) – is augmented by the sweetness of his new relationship with Ethel, one that
        fosters new experiences but cannot replace his aching memories. He never takes Ethel to
        the Black Elks Club, for example, as “that memory was special to Henry, something he
        couldn’t easily share” (259). Despite his nagging hope to be reunited with Keiko and
        the short duration of Henry and Ethel’s relationship, Henry ultimately proposes to
        Ethel on V-J Day, the day on which the Japanese surrender World War II. This sweet,
        spontaneous moment of engagement is celebrated by onlookers as “the crowd roared its
        approval, and men and women tilted their glasses back and toasted her” (261). However,
        as always, the sweetness of celebrating love and commitment is tinged with a bit of
        sadness as Henry momentarily gives up on his long-awaited reunion with Keiko, and
        even more so, the sadness behind Henry’s angry farewell to his dying father. Upon
        his deathbed, his father confesses to intercepting letter after letter that Henry
        wrote to Keiko, thinking that it would be in his son’s best interests. Although
        Henry never has a chance to reconcile conflict with his parents, after his father’s
        death, Henry understands his duty to help his mother with funeral planning, prepare
        for his upcoming trip to China, and “find a suitable engagement ring. Something he
        would do with a certain sadness. He’d do what he always did, find the sweet among
        the bitter” (265). Through Henry’s relationships with Ethel and Keiko, and through
        his tumultuous relationship with his father, this book highlights the unrelenting
        push and pull between bitter and sweet moments.
      <p>After experiencing prejudice and discrimination throughout his youth, Henry
        eventually seeks justice with the bullies who tormented him in grade school.
        While Chaz becomes “bitter and defeated… the way he’d look for the rest of his
        life” (209), Henry grows stronger and more resilient to life’s hardships. The
        sense of satisfaction that Henry experiences upon realizing his strength is,
        effectively, the sweet revenge that he takes upon these bullies. When Henry
        and Chaz encounter each other on the corner of South King, Henry realizes
        that he is “actually looking down an inch or two” (247) on his former
        tormentor. Chaz ends up cowardly backing away, “more pathetic and
        annoying than menacing” (247). Henry’s maturity and confidence, as well
        as his height, represent his mental and physical growth throughout the ages,
        symbolizing the transition from his bitter and unjust childhood to a sweeter
        life where he can forge his own path.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the strain and pent-up bitterness between Henry and his father continues to
        grow until his father finds Keiko’s belongings hidden under Henry’s bed – ultimately his
        father disowns him by saying, “‘If you walk out that door – if you walk out that door now,
        you are no longer part of this family. You are no longer Chinese. You are not part of us
        anymore’” (185). This sense of resentment stays with Henry’s father until his dying breath,
        and he is never able to forgive his son for disobeying his wishes. However, as years tick
        by, Henry is able to reconnect with Keiko with the help of his once-distant son. The
        sweetness between Henry and Marty, and Marty’s kind gesture of purchasing a
        “round-trip ticket to New York City” (276), reminds Henry of his past. His son and
        new daughter-in-law allow Henry the opportunity to reconnect with Keiko in New York City,
        finally allowing himself to “‘find what’s missing… to find what [he] let go’” (276).
        As the saying goes, distance and time make the heart fonder. Henry’s long-awaited reunion
        with Keiko is a sweet conclusion to a story filled with harsh family conflicts and
        discrimination, illustrating the importance and interdependence of both bitter
        and sweet experiences in life.</p>
      <p>To capture the racial and cultural differences within the book, I baked a cake that
        looks like the <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattles-panama-hotel-deemed-a-national-treasure/" id="hcbslinks">
        Panama Hotel</a>, the namesake of the novel. Not only is the hotel the spot where
        an older Henry remembers his youth, but it’s described as a “gateway between Seattle's
        Chinatown and Nihonmachi, Japantown” (3). I chose to create three distinct flavored
        layers to highlight the stark differences that separate American, Chinese, and
        Japanese cultures.</p>
      <p>While baking the cake, I referenced recipes from <a href="https://howtocakeit.com/blogs/recipes" id="hcbslinks">How to Cake It</a>,
        <a href="http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/" id="hcbslinks"> Sally’s Baking Addiction</a>,
        <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites" id="hcbslinks">Real Simple</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.flavorandfortune.com/" id="hcbslinks">Flavor and Fortune</a>. These cakes are
        delicious, of course, but they are also sturdy, which is important when creating a tall,
        <a href="https://veenaazmanov.com/double-barrel-cakes/" id="hcbslinks">double barrel</a> cake.
        To feed the 24 students in the class, I calculated that I would need to bake around 6
        layers, and used 6” square pans to do so.</p>
      <p>I mixed up How to Cake It’s <a href="https://howtocakeit.com/blogs/recipes/yos-ultimate-vanilla-cake" id="hcbslinks">ultimate vanilla cake recipe</a>
        for the top third of the cake, as vanilla is a classic, timeless American cake flavor. Using
        the same batter, I folded in chopped peanuts, dried coconut, and topped the cakes with
        sesame seeds prior to baking to emulate the flavors of
        <a href="http://www.flavorandfortune.com/dataaccess/recipe.php?ID=867" id="hcbslinks">dragon’s beard candy</a>.
        The candy is one of the confections that Samantha makes for Henry later on in the book,
        showcasing its importance in bridging the gap between American and Chinese cultures.
        The recipe for the bottom third of the cake is a
        <a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/matcha-cake-vanilla-buttercream" id="hcbslinks">matcha batter</a>
        from Real Simple, and I flavored it with matcha to both reference Samantha’s ice cream choice
        and acknowledge the opening of a
        <a href="https://seattle.curbed.com/2018/4/30/17303288/panama-hotel-seattle-history-preservation" id="hcbslinks">Tea House</a>
        on the main floor of the hotel.</p>
      <p>Matcha in its purest form is rather bitter, which is yet another reference to the title of the
        book, and this indicates the bitterness of the Japanese-American experience during World War II.
        However, matcha can also be combined with small amounts of flavorings and sugars to become much
        sweeter and more palatable. While Keiko serves Henry “a glass of iced green tea, with ginger
        and honey from the taste of it” (285), I chose to use granulated sugar because it has important
        properties such as aerating a batter and keeping cakes fluffy, which does not always happen
        with honey. Furthermore, I chose to omit ginger from the recipe to highlight the pure matcha flavor.</p>
      <p>In the bottom few layers of the cake, I also created a small “secret chamber” and filled it
        with small candies, signifying the hidden belongings in the basement of the hotel. I chose
        to use Skittles candies and rainbow sprinkles to represent the colorful, yet obscured past of the
        Japanese immigrants. The technique for the “secret chamber” is featured in quite a few of How to Cake It’s
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kklxoQlglZg" id="hcbslinks">video tutorials</a>, and even though
        it was my first time trying this technique, it wasn’t too difficult to do.</p>
      <p>For structural purposes, I chose to use plain vanilla buttercream to layer and frost the
        cake, as buttercream is extremely sturdy. I’ve made buttercream so many times now that I
        do it by eye, but the recipe on which I originally based my measurements is from
        <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/vanilla-buttercream/" id="hcbslinks">Sally’s Baking Addiction</a>!
        I like to use salted butter in my buttercream because it prevents the frosting from getting
        too sweet, although I would be careful and make sure that there aren’t pockets of unmixed
        salted butter.</p>
      <p>The exterior of the cake is decorated as closely as possible to the appearance of the Panama
        Hotel, and I used
        <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Seattle-s-Panama-Hotel-is-a-national-treasure-6197611.php" id="hcbslinks">images of the hotel
        as it currently stands</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.historylink.org/File/9544" id="hcbslinks">photographs from the 1940s</a>,
        as references while decorating.</p>
      <p>While a cake may not be a traditional way of representing these ideas, I hope that the elements
        that I incorporated, such as distinct flavors, a symbolic basement chamber, and exterior decorations
        convey the many cultural tensions between American, Chinese, and Japanese communities during
        the 1940s. I thoroughly enjoyed reading <i>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</i>,
        brainstorming ideas for how to represent the different cultures, and conducting research
        to make this cake and its flavors as authentic as possible. I’m deeply grateful to have had
        the opportunity to combine my passion for baking with my education, and I hope that the
        class enjoys the cake!</p>
