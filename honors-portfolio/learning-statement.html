                <h4>Learning Statement</h4>

                <p>When I was admitted to UW and the Allen School in 2018, I thought that computer science (CS)
                was only about robots, hackathons, and big tech. I genuinely stumbled into this field by accident.
                However, during the department‚Äôs Early Fall Start (EFS) course, a lecture by Professor Emeritus
                Richard Ladner introduced me to how CS can be applied to advance equity and improve accessibility.
                Since then, I‚Äôve embraced opportunities to connect my research and entrepreneurship experiences and
                drive social change with technology.</p>

                <p>In my first year, I attended the Study Away Silicon Valley (SASV) program as one of five students
                in the UW delegation. This week cemented my interest in and passion for accessibility, answering
                questions while giving rise to new curiosities. Back then, I would have never guessed that this
                one week would lay the groundwork for me to start an accessible technology venture and reconsider
                my entire career trajectory.</p>

                <p>Before my junior year, I never imagined pursuing academia because I had never seen anyone
                who looked like me in the field. Working with role models and mentors I could relate to was critical
                to inspiring me to break away from my fear of failure, to envision a career in academia, and to apply
                for a PhD. In the fall of my senior year, I took a leap of faith and applied to PhD programs in HCI
                and accessibility. I was inspired by the professors I had worked with, and kept on coming back to the
                projects that excited me so much more than the ones I had seen previously in industry.</p>

                <p>I‚Äôm thankful for the extraordinary people and opportunities at UW that have helped me discover my
                future path and my passions for accessibility, teaching, and empathetic leadership. This journey has not
                been linear, nor has it been straightforward, but I believe that the obstacles and roadblocks that I
                faced have shaped me into who I am today. As I pursue a PhD and the possibilities that lie beyond, I
                aspire to become someone who can illuminate and empower others to find their own pathway.</p>
