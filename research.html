              <div class="pad-top-10">
                <p>Ever since my second quarter at UW, I’ve worked on developing voice-based technology for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community
                  with Dr. Leah Findlater in the Human Centered Design and Engineering department (HCDE). As an undergraduate, I wrote interview protocols
                  and sought out published papers and peers for insights to constantly iterate on drafts.</p>
                <p>Our first paper explores interactive sound design for websites, going beyond traditional screen reader paradigms
                  to augment the auditory experience. In one of our research meetings, I posed my own research question about the customization of
                  social media profiles and how people who are blind or visually impaired would use voice to represent themselves or hear others’ personalities –
                  this question ultimately became the core of our paper published at CSCW 2021. For both papers, I conducted qualitative data analysis
                  and worked with one of Dr. Findlater’s PhD students to develop and validate a codebook as well as synthesize critical points from our interview results.</p>
                <p>In junior year, I started <a href="https://www.verbaleyes.co/">VerbalEyes</a> with my peers as part of a capstone course jointly offered through
                  our university’s computer science and entrepreneurship departments. We aimed to address the issue of audio description (AD) provision from the perspectives of
                  the blind and visually impaired community as well as AD providers. The initial idea for automating audio description creation came from
                  a discussion I had with my blind friend, during which he mentioned that the dearth of AD on both studio and user produced videos
                  made a vast majority of online content inaccessible to the BVI community.</p>
                <p>As the UX Research Lead, I drew on my background in accessibility research to build survey and interview protocols from scratch, and I expanded
                  our outreach efforts by posting surveys on a variety of online forums, garnering over 110 responses from BVI individuals.
                  I was responsible for conducting interviews, analyzing user research data (both quantitative and qualitative), and synthesizing feedback and perspectives
                  into finished designs and workflows. My contributions did not just lie in understanding what the BVI community wanted,
                  but also in puzzling through how to design and deliver a user experience that solved critical pain points for multiple groups of stakeholders.</p>
                <p>Our research on AD preferences and automation was awarded the
                  <a href="https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/tapia-2021-post-award-winners/">1st Place Undergraduate Research Poster award</a> at the
                  2021 CMD-IT / ACM Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference. We are currently building out our minimum viable product and are working with
                  universities across the nation to help them provide quality AD quickly and efficiently to BVI students. This year, I am also expanding on
                  this prior work for my undergraduate honors thesis, advised by Dr. Richard Ladner.</p>
