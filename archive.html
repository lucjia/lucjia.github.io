<h1>Research</h1>
<p>Ever since my second quarter at UW, I've worked on developing voice-based technology for the blind and low vision (BLV) community
    with Dr. Leah Findlater in the Human Centered Design and Engineering department (HCDE). As an undergraduate, I wrote interview protocols
    and sought out published papers and peers for insights to constantly iterate on drafts.</p>
<p>Our first paper explores interactive sound design for websites, going beyond traditional screen reader paradigms
    to augment the auditory experience. In one of our research meetings, I posed my own research question about the customization of
    social media profiles and how people who are blind or have low vision would use voice to represent themselves or hear others' personalities –
    this question ultimately became the core of our paper published at CSCW 2021. For both papers, I conducted qualitative data analysis
    and worked with one of Dr. Findlater's PhD students to develop and validate a codebook as well as synthesize critical points from our interview results.</p>
<p>In junior year, I started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210910172528/https://www.verbaleyes.co/">VerbalEyes</a> with my peers as part of a capstone course jointly offered through
    our university's computer science and entrepreneurship departments. We aimed to address the issue of audio description (AD) provision from the perspectives of
    the blind and low vision community as well as AD providers. The initial idea for automating audio description creation came from
    a discussion I had with my blind friend, during which he mentioned that the dearth of AD on both studio and user produced videos
    made a vast majority of online content inaccessible to the BVI community.</p>
<p>As the UX Research Lead, I drew on my background in accessibility research to build survey and interview protocols from scratch, and I expanded
    our outreach efforts by posting surveys on a variety of online forums, garnering over 110 responses from BVI individuals.
    I was responsible for conducting interviews, analyzing user research data (both quantitative and qualitative), and synthesizing feedback and perspectives
    into finished designs and workflows. My contributions did not just lie in understanding what the BVI community wanted,
    but also in puzzling through how to design and deliver a user experience that solved critical pain points for multiple groups of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Our research on AD preferences and automation was awarded the
    <a href="https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/tapia-2021-post-award-winners/">1st Place Undergraduate Research Poster award</a> at the
    2021 CMD-IT / ACM Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference. We are currently building out our minimum viable product and are working with
    universities across the nation to help them provide quality AD quickly and efficiently to BVI students. In my last year of undergrad, I expanded on
    my work in audio description for my senior thesis, entitled <i>Co-Designing Systems to Support Blind and Low Vision Audio Description Scriptwriters</i>, which
    received the <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2022/06/24/be-brave-be-kind-and-do-great-things-allen-school-celebrates-the-graduates-of-2020-2021-and-2022/">2022
    Outstanding Senior Thesis award</a> from UW CSE.</p>

<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>In 2012, after more than six years of taking inline skating lessons, I became one of the youngest skaters to pass the Level 1 Certification
    and began teaching inline skating at <a href="https://skatejourneys.org/">Skate Journeys Skate School</a> in Bellevue, Washington.
    Every weekend, I would lace up my skates to teach both kids and adults how to find balance, perseverance, and excitement on wheels.
    Though I spent more than six summers as a camp counselor, I could still see myself in my students' shoes (skates?) and loved being able to
    work with students to develop individual plans for perfecting their technique.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at UW, I've developed a passion for creating community, advocating for equity, and expanding access to CS education.
    My journey in teaching CS began in 2019, when I was accepted to TA for the
    <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190e/19au/">Early Fall Start (EFS) course</a> I had taken the year prior.
    Having been in the students' shoes, I spent months developing course and extracurricular materials to support incoming students
    from underrepresented backgrounds (from low-resource schools, first-generation students, students with disabilities, etc.)
    so they would have the tools to combat these same feelings of impostor syndrome I felt before. Through teaching EFS,
    I felt my joy for teaching return – it was this same sense of purpose I'd felt when teaching inline skating back in high school.</p>
<p>Since 2019, I've been a TA for a variety of courses in the Allen School. As a TA for HCI, I consistently remind students that
    technology is not built independently of its users – it must be built intentionally, with, by, and for those who will ultimately benefit from it.
    I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to guest lecture about visual design and communication to a class of 60 students in Autumn 2021. My love for
    empowering students and helping them navigate the complexities of both life and education will continue to drive me in the future,
    and I aim to build on these teaching experiences even further in graduate school by designing and teaching a new course focused on accessible technology.</p>

<h1>Leadership</h1>
<p>Outside of research and academics, I'm dedicated to making the field of computer science more accessible by breaking down barriers
    and building support systems for the next generation of computer scientists. Technology cannot be built in a vacuum, and ensuring that
    people of all backgrounds are represented and feel welcome within the field of computing is one of my core values.
    Furthermore, accessibility research cannot be conducted without the voices and input of the disability community. It is the responsibility of researchers
    to center the voices of disabled researchers and users, educate themselves on and consistently challenge disability in today's society,
    and commit to conducting ethical research.</p>
<p>In fall of 2019, I joined <a href="https://acm.cs.washington.edu/">UW Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>'s executive board, and
    since fall of 2020, I've served as Chair. I've empowered new admits and experienced students to find their communities, both during the isolating
    pandemic and through the tumultuous transition back to in-person events. This year, we saw a 44% increase in signups for the fourth year of our
    Big / Little peer mentorship program, in which we match experienced students with new admits based on technical interests, hobbies, and identities (if they choose).
    As Chair, I oversaw all logistics and helped with event coordination, advertising, and matching. Many enter the Allen School thinking that
    it will be a rigorous and competitive environment. However, participants shared that this program helped them realize that the Allen School
    is much more collaborative than they thought.</p>
<p>Alongside our social events, I led ACM in running our first ever fundraising events last year. During the pandemic, we partnered with local organizations
    in Seattle; we raised over $5000 for the University District Food Bank, Code.org, Black Girls CODE, and Seattle Children's Hospital combined.
    This year, during our first post-pandemic autumn quarter social, we hosted over 250 attendees and received more than 60 donations from students and faculty,
    exceeding our goal of raising $1500 for the University District Food Bank. Leading ACM was one of the highlights of my college experience, and it was incredibly fun
    to wrap up Spring 2022 with our first Spring BBQ since 2019! At graduation, I had the honor of presenting ACM Teaching Awards to three excellent faculty in the
    Allen School, and I also received the Service Award for my work with ACM.</p>
<p>In June 2020, I and other student leaders founded Student Leaders for Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (SLIDE),
    a coalition supporting student-led advocacy to improve racial and intersectional diversity efforts in CS.
    We've met with directors and faculty to push for inclusive hiring and resources for underrepresented students,
    resulting in concrete changes to the department's strategic plan for diversity. Through both ACM and SLIDE, I work to uplift
    underrepresented groups in computing, and help them build connections and find friendships that will last beyond their college years.</p>
