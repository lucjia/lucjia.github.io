            <p>Outside of research and academics, I’m dedicated to making the field of computer science more accessible by breaking down barriers
              and building support systems for the next generation of computer scientists. Technology cannot be built in a vacuum, and ensuring that
              people of all backgrounds are represented and feel welcome within the field of computing is one of my core values.
              Furthermore, accessibility research cannot be conducted without the voices and input of the disability community. It is the responsibility of researchers
              to center the voices of disabled researchers and users, educate themselves on and consistently challenge disability in today’s society,
              and commit to conducting ethical research.</p>
            <p>In fall of 2019, I joined <a href="https://acm.cs.washington.edu/">UW Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>’s executive board, and
              since fall of 2020, I’ve served as Chair. I’ve empowered new admits and experienced students to find their communities, both during the isolating
              pandemic and through the tumultuous transition back to in-person events. This year, we saw a 44% increase in signups for the fourth year of our
              Big / Little peer mentorship program, in which we match experienced students with new admits based on technical interests, hobbies, and identities (if they choose).
              As Chair, I oversaw all logistics and helped with event coordination, advertising, and matching. Many enter the Allen School thinking that
              it will be a rigorous and competitive environment. However, participants shared that this program helped them realize that the Allen School
              is much more collaborative than they thought.</p>
            <p>Alongside our social events, I led ACM in running our first ever fundraising events last year. During the pandemic, I partnered with local organizations
              in Seattle; we raised over $3460 for the University District Food Bank, Code.org, and Seattle Children’s Hospital combined.
              This year, I hope to surpass our fundraising goals from last year to amplify ACM’s impact.</p>
            <p>In June 2020, I and other student leaders founded Student Leaders for Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (SLIDE),
              a coalition supporting student-led advocacy to improve racial and intersectional diversity efforts in CS.
              We’ve met with directors and faculty to push for inclusive hiring and resources for underrepresented students,
              resulting in concrete changes to the department’s strategic plan for diversity. Through both ACM and SLIDE, I work to uplift
              underrepresented groups in computing, and help them build connections and find friendships that will last beyond their college years.</p>
