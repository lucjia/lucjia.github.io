                <p>Hi! I'm Lucy, and I'm an analytic problem solver with a passion for designing and building sustainable, scalable, and empathy-driven solutions.
                  I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science and Entrepreneurship at the University of Washington, with a focus on accessibility!
                  I am also part of the Interdisciplinary Honors program and I am finishing up Departmental Honors in the Allen School (advised by Dr. Richard Ladner).
                  This fall, I'm applying for PhD programs in HCI and accessible technology.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I love baking! üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥ Although my family never used the oven when I was younger, I began baking in middle school and have loved it ever since.
                  My favorite bakes are artistic cakes and cookies inspired by classical art, memes, or even coursework. I've shared a couple of my favorite cakes on this page!
                  You can also check out more of my work on my informal <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucyajiang/">Instagram portfolio</a>. üßÅ</p>
                <p>I also enjoy bakery and restaurant hopping and trying creative flavor combinations! Some of my favorite dessert places near UW are
                  Hiroki and Snowy Village, and some of my restaurant picks include Agua Verde and Bugis. Cooking is also a hobby of mine, although I tend to
                  prioritize efficiency and practicality when cooking for myself - I'm a big fan of one-pot meals or everything stir fries. üçõ</p>
                <p>Rain or shine, I enjoy walking, inline skating, hiking, and exploring the PNW. During the pandemic, I became especially fond of
                  taking long walks around the U District and Green Lake neighborhoods. This past summer, I walked all across New York City and
                  covered more than 285 miles over 12 weeks! Although I'm someone who absolutely detests long distance running, I recently surprised myself by
                  running (and finishing!) a half marathon in the pouring rain with my older sister. Maybe, just maybe, one day I'll start liking running! üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
