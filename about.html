                <p>Hi! I'm Lucy, and I'm an analytic problem solver with a passion for designing and building sustainable, scalable, and empathy-driven solutions.
                  I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship. While at UW, I was
									also part of the Interdisciplinary and Departmental Honors programs (CSE Honors advised by Dr. Richard Ladner).
                  This fall, I started my PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY!</p>
                <p>In my free time, I love baking! üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥ Although my family never used the oven when I was younger, I began baking in middle school and have loved it ever since.
                  My favorite bakes are artistic cakes and cookies inspired by classical art, memes, or even coursework. I've shared a couple of my favorite cakes on this page!
                  You can also check out more of my work on my informal <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucyajiang/">Instagram portfolio</a>. üßÅ</p>
                <p>I also enjoy bakery and restaurant hopping and trying creative flavor combinations! Some of my favorite dessert places near UW are
                  Hiroki and Snowy Village, and some of my restaurant picks include Agua Verde and Bugis. Cooking is another hobby of mine, although I tend to
                  prioritize efficiency and practicality when cooking for myself - I'm a big fan of one-pot meals or everything stir fries.
									When I'm not making, getting, or eating food, you can find me listening to my ever-growing library of songs on Spotify,
									watching Netflix, or playing games such as Set, Clue, TypeRacer, and Quordle.</p>
                <p>Rain or shine, I enjoy walking, inline skating, hiking, traveling, and exploring the PNW. During the pandemic, I became especially fond of
                  taking long walks around the U District and Green Lake neighborhoods. In 2021, I walked all across New York City and
                  covered more than 285 miles over 12 weeks! This past summer, I've walked through a handful of European cities (and even took a free Netflix walking
									tour just for fun)! In Ithaca, I've become fond of the Cascadilla Gorge Trail - the autumn colors are absolutely beautiful. 
                  Although I'm someone who absolutely detests long distance running, I recently surprised myself by
                  running (and finishing!) a half marathon in the pouring rain with my older sister. Maybe, just maybe, one day I'll start liking running! üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
